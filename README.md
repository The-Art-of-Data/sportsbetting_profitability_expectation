# sportsbetting_profitability_expectation

This project explores the likelihood of a sports bettor being profitable long term based on price edge. The full simulation will take several hours if run as is using the provded notebook. Feel free to contact me at rabbitcoin888@gmail.com for a .py file that uses Python's multiprocessing library to run the simulation in parrallel which drastically reduces simulation time.
